        <h1>My <span>Journey</span> as a <span>Passionate Inventor</span></h1>
<p>
    My passion for building and inventing began around the age of 10. With limited resources, I learned to create my own toys and experiments, turning curiosity into hands-on projects.
</p>
<p>
    Early experiments ranged from crafting models and simple mechanical projects to observing ecosystems and exploring basic chemistry and physics. These experiences nurtured my curiosity and problem-solving skills.
</p>
<p>
    As I grew older, I focused on science and technology, studying Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science. In Grade 11, I built a motor exploring magnetism and created a simple battery for a chemistry project.
</p>

<p>
    After completing Grade 13, personal circumstances prevented me from continuing formal education. Undeterred, I pursued self-directed learning, gaining intermediate experience in game development with Unity, 3D modeling in Blender, sound editing in FL Studio, and character design in Ibis Paint.
</p>
<p>
    In 2023, I explored IoT (Internet of Things) by researching independently and acquiring my first Arduino. I built small robots, controlled lights, and experimented with motors, further expanding my technical skills.
</p>
<p>
    Around the same time, I challenged myself to learn web development in one month to participate in Webcup, a 24-hour website development competition. My first entry was basic, but it motivated me to improve.
</p>
<p>
    The following year, I created a more refined project and proudly achieved 3rd place. This experience reinforced my dedication to innovation and problem-solving, reminding me of my childhood dream—to create anything I imagined.
</p>
<p>
    Today, I continue to pursue my passion, funding projects through small entrepreneurial activities and constantly learning new skills, always seeking opportunities to innovate and build.
