        <h1>My <span>Journey </span> as a <span>Passionate Inventor</span></h1>
        <p >
                I remember when I first became passionate about building things—I was around 10 years old. Growing up, 
                I didn’t always have other kids to play with, so I depended on toys for entertainment.
                But I always wanted new ones, and since my family had limited means, I became interested in making my own. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It started with simple projects: I crafted a laptop out of cardboard, 
            molded my favorite Ben 10 aliens with plasticine, and even made them "fight" using magnets under the table.
            My curiosity went beyond just building—I wondered why insects couldn't breathe underwater and if I could mutate them to survive there.
            I even experimented with fire in the sand, hoping to create a miniature volcano (which, unfortunately, resulted in burns and bee stings from my other experiments).
            I also built a small ecosystem in a container, adding sea fish, crabs, shrimp, algae, and sand to observe how they interacted.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I grew older, my passion for science led me to study Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science.
            In Grade 11, I built a motor that could only rotate left and right, exploring magnetism.
            I also created a simple battery using lemons for a chemistry project.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, after finishing Grade 13, I faced personal challenges that prevented me from continuing formal education. Still,
            my love for learning never stopped. I turned to YouTube, where I taught myself game development with Unity,
            3D modeling in Blender, sound editing in FL Studio, character design in Ibis Paint, 
            and many other skills—all while continuing to craft new inventions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, I applied for an IoT (Internet of Things) course while considering Business Computing.
            Unfortunately, due to the limited educational opportunities in Rodrigues, the IoT course never materialized. 
            Still, I prepared myself by researching IoT and buying my first Arduino, which I used to build small robots,
            control lights, and experiment with motors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around the same time, I heard about Webcup, a 24-hour website development competition.
            Even though I had no prior web development experience, I challenged myself to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in just one month.
            My first attempt at the competition resulted in a rough website, and though I was disappointed,
            I promised myself that the next year, I would do better.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following year, I built something much more refined. Though I always strive for perfection,
            I was surprised and proud to win 3rd place. This experience reinforced my passion for creating and solving problems,
            reminding me of the childhood dream I had—to build anything I imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even now, as I continue to look for job opportunities, I remain committed to my passion.
            I raise chickens and grow vegetables to fund my Arduino projects, always finding ways to keep building,
            learning, and creating.
